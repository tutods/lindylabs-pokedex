## üìÑ Roadmap

This project is a **Coding Challenge** for a **[Lindy Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lindy-labs/)** opportunity. The requirements for this
**Code Challenge** are:

-   [x] Have a web page that allows a user to enter a Pok√©mon name;
    -   In my case, I create a grid to show all Pok√©mons;
    -   If you don't have any filter, you will see 9 Pok√©mons when start, and if you want you can load 9 more each time you press **Load more
        Pok√©mons** button.
-   [x] When submitting, query [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co) and display the given
        Pok√©mon (at least name, number and sprite), or an error message if no
        match is found;
    -   When you make a search, first thing I do is validate if my state contains any Pok√©mon to match with id or name. If not, make a request to **
        [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co)**;
    -   When return one result, the modal with details will open automatically.
-   [x] Provide ‚ÄúPrevious‚Äù & ‚ÄúNext‚Äù buttons, that switch to the previous/next
        Pok√©mons, base on their id number;
-   [x] Provide a text-based search feature, where inputting a name or partial
        name should look for a matching Pok√©mon and show it;
-   [ ] Have at least two automated tests, for the two features above;
    -   **IMPROVEMENT:** this point is an improvement to learn new skills and finish all requirements on this challenge.

### Additional Points

This 3 points are essential on each project I do!

-   [x] **ESLint** configuration;
-   [x] Add **Husky** and **Lint Staged** to run on each commit;
-   [x] Add **Commit Lint** to follow the guidelines on commit messages;
